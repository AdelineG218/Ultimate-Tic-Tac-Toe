Tic-tac-toe but for big kids (and with waffles).

## Installation and Usage

Download the project files to your machine. (You may also need to set up C++.) Then, open the folder in your chosen editor.

In the terminal run "make"
```bash
> make
```
To play the game, run the executable called ".\UTTT.exe"
```bash
> .\UTTT.exe
```
This will create a popup window where you will play the game. If you keep your terminal open, you'll see terminal outputs reminding you whose turn it is.

## How to Play
The game follows the standard rules of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe. Your goal is to win enough of the smaller boards to get three in a row on the larger board.
